# Clean Translation

A proof of concept app for managing multiple languages in a web application

- As a developer, I code the application once for all languages
- As a developer, I do not need to re-deploy to incorporate new or fixed translated sentences
- As a translator, I can read, update, and add translated sentences with close to no tech knownledge
- As an end-user, I can switch language without reloading the app
